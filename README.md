# Seaside Modular VCV Rack Plugin

## Proteus Module

Proteus is a generative sequencer. It creates a melody, then loops that melody for a while, until it gets bored and creates a new one. While it's looping the melody, it may transpose by octave or mutate individual notes as controlled by the knobs or CV.
