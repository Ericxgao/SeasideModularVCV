## Proteus Expander Module v2.3.0

ProteusX adds functionality to the Proteus generative sequencer. ProteusX doesn't do anything on its own. 

### Connection

ProteusX should be placed immediately to the right side of a Proteus module. When a connection is made, the lights on the upper left hand side of ProteusX and on the upper right hand side of Proteus will illuminate. 

### Pattern bank

The pattern bank is for saving and re-laoding patterns that Proteus creates. If Proteus makes a melody that you like and wish to return to, you can save it in one of the five slots. Once melodies are saved in the slots, you either recall melodies using the LOAD buttons, or you can use triggers into the Next, Prev, and Rand inputs to change among the stored patterns. 

To prevent accidental overwrite, you cannot save a pattern into a slot which already has a pattern saved. To free a slot, you must first press the CLEAR button to clear the slot. 

### Additional controls

***Transpose***

By default, Proteus makes its melodies in the key of C. If you wish to use a different root note, you can use the transpose knob or CV input to transpose all of the melodies by semitone. 

***Rest***

This knob and CV input will play silent rest notes after the completion of each loop.
