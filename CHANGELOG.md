# Changelog

## v2.1.0 - 21 Sept 2022

• Added RESET jack

• Density changes are now dynamic

• The bottom switch now controls octave range instead of octave change direction. Left position: 0, no octave transpositions; Middle position: 1, can transpose up or down 1 octave from the starting position; 2, can transpose up or down 2 octaves from the starting positions (this was the original setting)

• Added Dorian and Chromatic scales

• Proteus now saves its melody on save/autosave

• Improved state persistence in general

• Improved gate length handling (hopefully addresses bug where gate stays high on startup)
